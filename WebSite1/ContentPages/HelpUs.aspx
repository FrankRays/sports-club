        Frequently Asked Questions:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        <a name="shopcart8"><strong><span>What is this shopping cart thing?</span></strong></a><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>The shopping cart is the mechanism by which the store keeps track of your 
        order, as if you were putting items into a cart at the supermarket. The idea is 
        that you don’t have to actually pay when you drop items into the cart, and you 
        can remove them, change quantities, and so on before you go to checkout. In some 
        stores you can edit the order directly, and in other stores, you have to click a 
        button named Modify Cart, or something like that. To remove an item, just revise 
        the quantity to read zero.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>In some stores, you can choose shipping methods at this time. Other stores 
        just ship by ground, so you don’t get a choice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>In a well-designed site, you can view your order or shopping cart at any 
        time. In a lousy site you have to pretend to buy something to see what you 
        already have in the cart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <a name="checkout8"><strong><span>What is checkout?</span></strong></a><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>As in a real store, when you have finally decided what you want to buy, 
        you wheel your cart by the checkout counter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>In many stores, this is the time you have to enter your credit card info, 
        or confirm the info you gave when you registered, which now shows up again 
        (except for your password). For instance, your billing and shipping addresses 
        appear all filled in, but you can change them now, although many stores insist 
        that your shipping and billing addresses match the address to which the credit 
        card company sends its bills. You also get one last chance to edit quantities 
        and remove products. Pay particular attention to the shipping method to make 
        sure that is really what you want. (In some systems, you must wait until 
        checkout to pick a shipping method, and find out how much it will cost only 
        during checkout. Ugh.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>When everything is the way you like it, click Submit or Order to send your 
        order in. In a well-designed site, you should immediately get a page confirming 
        the order details and asking you, one more time, to confirm that this is really, 
        really what you want. One more OK, and the order is really, really sent in. 
        (Poorly designed or greedy sites just accept your order the first time, not 
        giving you a moment to reconsider.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>In a few minutes an email should go out from the site confirming the 
        purchase. (You may get the confirmation in a quarter hour, or a few hours, 
        depending in part on the traffic on the Internet and the speed with which your 
        email is delivered.) Be sure to save this confirming email, in case anything 
        goes wrong with the order. You might even consider setting up a folder to save 
        mail from stores so you can find it quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <a name="shipoptions9"><strong><span>What shipping options do I have?</span></strong></a><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>Some stores ship only by ground or via the mail. But most offer a variety 
        of methods, with delivery coming the next day, or two or three days after the 
        product leaves the store. (Remember, the store may take a while to pack your 
        order, which adds significantly to the total time until delivery.) Here are 
        typical options offered by Sports Club using delivery services:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>• Overnight, in the morning or during the day<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>• 2nd</span><span class="apple-converted-space"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Day<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>• 3rd</span><span class="apple-converted-space"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Day<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>• Ground, which means about a week of business days<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>• Saturday (not offered very often)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        <a name="how10"><strong><span>
        <o:p>
        &nbsp;</o:p></span></strong></a></p>
    <p>
        <span><strong>
        <o:p>
        &nbsp;</o:p></strong></span></p>
    <p>
        <span><strong>How can I return a product?</strong><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>Basically, you must contact the store and get their OK before you send the 
        product back, for whatever reason, and you should do this quickly, to make sure 
        you are within the time frame they have established for returns<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <a name="when"><strong><span>When do I get the credit?</span></strong></a><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>If you can return a product for credit, the credit shows up about three 
        weeks after the product reaches the vendor. Most of that delay is due to the 
        credit card companies slow accounting processes, not the store.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <a name="whatfraud1"><strong><span>What can I do if I am the victim of fraud?</span></strong></a><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>Gather all the information you saved or printed when you were ordering, 
        and call the store’s customer service department. Try to straighten things out 
        directly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>If the store refuses to consider your complaints, or temporizes, or just 
        plain doesn’t answer the phone, you’d better talk to your credit card company 
        right away. Give them the full details, and ask for the charge to be removed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>If you sent a check, call your bank to stop payment. (If you used a debit 
        card, you are out the money, and may have a heck of a time recovering it.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>If you decide that the store really indulged in fraud, as opposed to being 
        incompetent, report the case in full detail to the Federal Trade Commission at<a 
            href="http://www.ftc.gov/">http://www.ftc.gov/</a><span 
            class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>or 202-FTC-HELP (382-4357), the 
        National Fraud Information Center at<a href="http://www.fraud.org/">http://www.fraud.org/</a><span 
            class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>or 1-800-876-7060, the Better Business 
        Bureau online at<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a 
            href="http://www.bbbonline.com/">http://www.bbbonline.com/</a><span 
            class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>, or your state attorney general. You 
        may not get your money back, but you are helping shut the scam artists down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <a name="change6"><strong><span>Can I change my account information?</span></strong></a><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>You have to enter your user name and password, and then choose Edit 
        Information, or Change User Name or Password. You make the changes, and press a 
        button such as Save or Submit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <a name="creditcard2"><strong><span>Do I have to use a credit card?</span></strong></a><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>No, but you do need to use one if you want delivery within a week or so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>You get the fastest delivery if you use the credit card on the Web store, 
        in its secure shopping area, or phone the store directly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>Also dangerous: using a debit card, because the money is transferred 
        immediately to the merchant, so you do not have the opportunity to cancel 
        payment, as you do with a credit card.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>
        <o:p>
        &nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <a name="if6"><strong><span>If I register or become a member, will I be deluged 
        with junk mail?</span></strong></a><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>Probably not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>But look for a promise of privacy. At the bottom of the registration form, 
        watch for a little button that says something like, &quot;From time to time we like 
        to let our members know about special bargains. Is this OK? Yes, No.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>Even if you let them send you email (this is called permission email), you 
        probably won’t get more than one notice a month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>Just to be safe, look carefully at the first email that arrives, to see 
        how you can cancel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>If the store is decent, they will tell you how to cancel the email, right 
        there at the top of the message.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>
        <span>If the store is run by weasels, and they don’t give you an easy way to 
        cancel, then go to the site and start emailing the president until they give up 
        and go away<o:p></o:p></span></p>
